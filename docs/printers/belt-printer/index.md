# Belted-Z Core-XY conversion kit

This is a conversion kit that will allow you to turn your Ender-3 printer and similar printers alike into a belted printer with an infinite Z-axis, allowing for infinitely "high" parts.

The actual belt runs back-to-front in respect to the printer.

The kinematics are of the Core-XY variant as to allow the gantry to be sat at the angle it is and be controlled without motors (and their weight) being present on the moving elements.
