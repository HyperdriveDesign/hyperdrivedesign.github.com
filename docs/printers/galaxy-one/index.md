# Galaxy One -- A printer

## Models

### Purely Printed

The classic experience: print your own parts and make your printer fully yours.  
Traditionally printed with ABS or ASA filament for the best and most predictable fit and performance.

### Hybrid Printed

Replaces some of the FDM-printed ABS parts with an alternative sandwich of lasercut sheet metal and plastic parts, with the option of using a polymer that's able to handle higher temperature environments.

### All CNC-machined

Comes with only CNC-machined aluminum parts for the motion system and other relevant systems, for the highest performance standard. These are well-suited for an actively heated chamber at high temperatures.

CNC-machined aluminium parts are available for purchase on the [Beaverton Milestone Hobby] webstore.
